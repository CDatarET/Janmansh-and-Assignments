Janmansh and Assignments
Janmansh has to submit 3 assignments for Chingari before 10 PM. He starts working on the assignments at X PM, and each assignment takes 1 hour to complete.

Determine whether Janmansh will be able to complete all the assignments on time.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T – the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain a single integer X – the time (in PM) when Janmansh starts the assignments.

Output Format
For each test case, print "Yes" if Janmansh can complete all assignments on or before 10 PM. Otherwise, print "No".

You may print each character of "Yes" and "No" in uppercase or lowercase (for example, YES, yes, yEs will be considered the same).
